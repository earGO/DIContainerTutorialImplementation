### What is this?
this is an implementation of this tutorial
https://www.raywenderlich.com/14223279-dependency-injection-tutorial-for-ios-getting-started

It's part of "complete 10 tutorials on MVVM and DI in Swift" that I've challenged myself with.

###What's different
As usual, the app in the tutorial is scaffolded using UIKit, but I need to practice SwiftUI, so I have rewrote it using pure SwiftUI app. Also as an additional complication I've used this API https://dummyapi.io/explorer, and decided to use the DI, created during the tutorial, to refactor the app to MVVM pattern.

Unlike the "Combine weather" tutorial, this time I've spend some time figuring out "the path to what they have as a starter project", since the gap between "code after me" and "create the app from scratch" is something I struggle after every UDEMY course. And next gap will be "create something complex production-grade", but that's for the tutorials to come. Anyways, this time it involved drawing some charts and schemas before writing some actual code.

Still isn't good enough, but I'm getting there.

My goal is to develop a methodology of creating apps with good clean scalable architecture from scratch. I have an example of the app architecture I aim for, and these are my steps to be able to produce this structure from the SwiftUI empty app, produced by xCode.
