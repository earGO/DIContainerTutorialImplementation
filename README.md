### What is this?
this is an implementation of this tutorial
https://www.raywenderlich.com/14223279-dependency-injection-tutorial-for-ios-getting-started

It's part of "complete 10 tutorials on MVVM and DI in Swift" that I've challenged myself with.

###What's different
As usual, the app in the tutorial is scaffolded using UIKit, but I need to practice SwiftUI, so I have rewrote it using pure SwiftUI app. Also as an additional complication I've used this API https://dummyapi.io/explorer, and decided to use the DI, created during the tutorial, to refactor the app to MVVM pattern.
